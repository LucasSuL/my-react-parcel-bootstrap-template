# React Parcel Bootstrap 5 Template

This template provides a structured starting point for a React project using the Parcel bundler and Bootstrap 5 for styling. The initial setup is inspired by Bob Ziroll's tutorial on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-up-a-react-app-with-parcel/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LucasSuL/my-react-parcel-bootstrap-template.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd my-react-parcel-bootstrap-template
   
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This would take some time.
   
4. **Start it up!**
   Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Parcel will handle the rest, and you'll have a fully-functional React app.
